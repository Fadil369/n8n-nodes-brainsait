- Add inline code comments for complex logic
- Update API documentation
- Include usage examples
- Document breaking changes

## Healthcare-Specific Guidelines

When contributing to healthcare-related features:

1. **HIPAA Compliance**: Ensure all patient data handling follows HIPAA guidelines
2. **NPHIES Standards**: Follow Saudi NPHIES integration specifications
3. **FHIR Compatibility**: Use FHIR R4 standards for healthcare resources
4. **Medical Accuracy**: Consult with healthcare professionals for clinical features
5. **Bilingual Support**: Test Arabic and English interfaces thoroughly
6. **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards

## Review Process

1. Automated checks must pass (tests, linting, type checking)
2. At least one core maintainer approval required
